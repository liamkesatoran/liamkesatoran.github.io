%MUSHROOMPDE
\cventry{2019}{Technical Research Assistant Intern, 6 months}{University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, J.A.Dieudone Research Institute}{Nice, France}{}{\begin{itemize} 
\item  Simulated and analyzed Dynamical Networks, e.g. social media networks or fungus growth.
            \item Mastered new models and uses of stochastic and partial differential equations in population dynamics.
            \item Implemented state of the art numerical fluid simulation techniques  and predictive models through Python.
            \item Solved the relationship between the physical parameters and the propagation speed for dynamical branching networks.

\begin{itemize} 
\item Analyzed compositional microbiological datasets using supervized \& unsupervized learning.
\item Coded several new compositional statistical data analysis methods with Python \& applied them to the Knight Lab datasets.
\item Discovered a long time unresolved bias that arises during unsupervized SVD dimensionality reduction and it's cause. 
\item Found a way to resolve it using better metrics. \textbf{Led a conference in front of 55 scientists} to explain the phenomenon.
\item This led to the following \textit{\underline{\smash{\href{https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Uncovering-the-Horseshoe-Effect-in-Microbial-Morton-Toran/b99fa36b375d3e7f3ec05785abc1d2229f3d34de}{research article}}}}  (11 citations).
